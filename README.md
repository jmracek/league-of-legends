Code for mining league match/summoner data using the Riot API

This project was something I undertook after I had defended my thesis in order to brush up my Python.
I had no experience working with web APIs.  I had no clue what HTTP was, or even what JSON was for that matter.
I had never built a relational database.  I wanted to learn all these skills, so I imagined building a database
of user match data related to the game, "League of Legends".  My goal at the time was to answer basic questions
about the importance of objectives, warding, etc., as well as building some basic tools for visualizing player
actions in game.

Anyone who looks closely at this code is going to smell the inexperience immediately.  It does not use any semblance
of a design pattern.  Every method is designed in an ad-hoc manner to achieve one specific task.  None of the behaviour
is abstracted away into a proper system.  It's truly incredible how it never feels like you're improving as a developer
until you look back at code you wrote just about 3 years ago and see that it's a total dumpster fire.
